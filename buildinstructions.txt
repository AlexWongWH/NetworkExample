Notes:

Creating a trading simulator
1. Client-side and Server side must be able to exchange data

Server side
1. Running the server & wait for client request
2. Send back acknowledge msg to respective clients
3. Contains `database` which holds the request -> (`Process` in the simulator)

Client side
1. Connect to server
2. Has to send request to server


Streched goals
Server supports multiple client request
Profiler
make client request generic...
create linux gui
configure cmake to pull dependencies from websit

really Streched goals
multi-thread... 
server creating a thread for each client?


Prototype 1:
Create seperate client and server executable
run both and check if it is able to receive the message
-> different terminal
-> different pc...
